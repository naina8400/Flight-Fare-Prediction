# Flight-Fare-Prediction

## Overview
- ### Introduction
The number of people who fly has dramatically increased in recent years. Pricing alters dynamically owing to many variables, making it difficult for airlines to maintain prices. As a result, we will attempt to solve this problem using machine learning. This can assist airlines in determining what rates they can keep. Customers can also use it to forecast future airline prices and plan their trips appropriately.
- ### Dataset
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh

There are two datasets here: the training set and the test set.
- ### Approach:
- Importing the training data
- Data pre-processing
- Importing test data and data pre-processing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Creating Independent and Dependent variables
- Features Selections
- Model Building
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Conclusion
- ### Inferences
-  Jet Airways has the most outliers in terms of price.
- the place from where passengers will travel to the destination and we can see that Banglore as the source location has the most outliers
- Jet Airways has maximum count of flights.
- Maximum number of flights departed from Delhi among all source cities.
- Cochin is at the top in list of destination cities.
- New Delhi is the most expensive destination city.
